# Sound Detector in Python*

## Introduction

This Sound Detector application is part of a series of how-to Intel® Internet of Things (IoT) code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, Intel® Edison development platform, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:<br>
- Connect the Intel® Edison development platform, a computing platform designed for prototyping and producing IoT and wearable computing products.<br>
- Interface with the Intel® Edison platform IO and sensor repository using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.<br>
- Store the Sound Detector data using Azure Redis Cache\* from Microsoft\* Azure\*, Redis Store\* from IBM\* Bluemix\*, or ElastiCache\* using Redis\* from Amazon Web Services\* (AWS), different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.
- Set up a MQTT-based server using IoT Hub from Microsoft\* Azure\*, IoT from IBM\* Bluemix\*, or IoT from Amazon Web Services\* (AWS), different cloud machine to machine messaging services based on the industry standard MQTT protocol.

## What it is

Using an Intel® Edison board, this project lets you create a smart loudness detector system that:<br>
- monitors a microphone sensor to detect the loudness in the area.<br>
- keeps track of access, using cloud-based data storage.

## How it works

This sound detector monitor uses the sensor to constantly keep track of the decibel level in a room.
Every 1sec the sensor finds the average sound samples and prints it to the RGB lcd screen.

Additionally, various events (looking-for-motion, motion-detected, invalid-code, etc.) are logged.
Optionally, all data can be stored using the Intel® IoT Examples Datastore running in your own Microsoft Azure account.
Also, optionally, the monitor stores the loudness data using the Intel® IoT Example Data store running in your own Microsoft Azure* account.

### How to set up

To begin, clone the **How-To Intel IoT Code Samples** repository with Git* on your computer as follows:

    $ git clone https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples.git

To download a .zip file, in your web browser go to <a href="https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples">https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples</a> and click the **Download ZIP** button at the lower right. Once the .zip file is downloaded, uncompress it, and then use the files in the directory for this example.

### Installing the program manually on the Intel® Edison board

You can set up the code manually on the Intel® Edison board.

Clone the **How-To Intel IoT Code Samples** repository to your Intel® Edison board after you establish an SSH connection to it, as follows:

    $ git clone https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples.git

Then, navigate to the directory with this example.

To install Git\* on the Intel® Edison board (if you don’t have it yet), establish an SSH connection to the board and run the following command:

    $ opkg install git

### Connecting the Grove\* sensors

![](./../../images/java/sound-detector.jpg)

You need to have a Grove* Shield connected to an Arduino-compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove devices into the Grove Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove Shield set to **5V**.

1. Plug one end of a Grove cable into the Grove Sound Sensor, and connect the other end to the A0 port on the Grove Shield.

2. Plug one end of a Grove cable into the Grove RGB LCD, and connect the other end to any of the I2C ports on the Grove Shield.

### Connecting the DFRobot\* sensors

You need to have a LCD Display Shield connected to an Arduino\*-compatible breakout board to plug all the DFRobot\* devices into the LCD Display Shield.

1. Plug one end of a DFRobot\* cable into the Analog Sound Sensor, and connect the other end to the A2 port on the LCD Display Shield.

### Intel® Edison board setup

If you're running this code on your Intel® Edison board, you need to install some dependencies by establishing an SSH session to the Edison and run the commands in the sections below.

#### Update the opkg repo

To add the Intel opkg repository:

    $ echo "src mraa-upm http://iotdk.intel.com/repos/3.5/intelgalactic/opkg/i586" > /etc/opkg/mraa-upm.conf
    $ opkg update

You'll only need to perform this step once.

#### Git

To install Git\* on the Intel® Edison board (if you don’t have it yet):

    $ opkg update
    $ opkg install git

#### MRAA and UPM Dependencies

To install the latest versions of the MRAA\* and UPM\* libraries:

    $ opkg update
    $ opkg install mraa
    $ opkg install upm

#### Python Package Manager (pip)

To install the Python\* package manager needed to install and run the example:

    $ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools


#### Install the example

Once all dependencies are installed you can install the example itself with the following command:

    $ pip install --src ~/python/examples/ -e "git+https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples.git#egg=iot_sound_detector&subdirectory=sound-detector/python"

The `pip` command will install required Python dependencies, save the source code for the example in `~/python/examples/iot_sound_detector/` and link the package to the global Python `site-packages` folder.

### Intel® IoT Gateway setup

You can run this example using an Intel® IoT Gateway connected to an Arduino\*/Genuino\* 101.

Make sure your Intel® IoT Gateway is setup, by following the directions on the web site here:

https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/633284

You must install the Intel® XDK on the Intel® IoT Gateway, by following the directions on the above link, under the section "Connecting to the Intel® XDK".

The Arduino\*/Genuino\* 101 needs to have the Firmata\* firmware installed. If you have IMRAA installed on your gateway, this will be done automatically. Otherwise, install the StandardFirmata or ConfigurableFirmata sketch manully on to your Arduino\*/Genuino\* 101.

You will also need to configure the `config.json` in the example to use the Arduino\*/Genuino\* 101. See the section "Configuring the example" below.

### Data store server setup

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, or AWS, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore)

### MQTT server setup

You can also optionally store the data generated by this sample program using MQTT, a machine-to-machine messaging server. You can use MQTT to connect to Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, or AWS.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud MQTT messaging server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt)

## Configuring the example

When the example is installed through `pip` the `config.json` file that holds the configuration for the example lives in `~/python/examples/iot_sound_detector/sound-detector/python/iot_sound_detector/config.json`.

To configure the example for the Grove* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "dfrobot"
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, or AWS data store, add the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file below the "CODE" key as follows:

```JSON
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/access-control",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for the optional Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, or AWS MQTT messaging server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt/](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt/)

## Running the program

Once the example is installed through `pip` you can run the program by running the following command in an SSH session to the board:

    $ python -m iot_sound_detector

### Determining the Intel® Edison board's IP address

You can determine what IP address the Intel® Edison board is connected to by running the following command:

    ip addr show | grep wlan

You will see the output similar to the following:

    3: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 1000
        inet 192.168.1.13/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global wlan0

The IP address is shown next to `inet`. In the example above, the IP address is `192.168.1.13`.
